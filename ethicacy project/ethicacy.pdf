####Clustering: an algorithm that  automatically categorizes search results into groups by topic.
####Clustering is one of the most common exploratory data analysis techniques used to get an intuition about the structure of the data.

####Clustering- The Good
Early history- in 2005 Microsoft Research started to experiment with a toolbar that clustered results in order to bring order to online searches. 
The company was one of the first to identify the potential problems generated by the sheer magnitude of results generated by each search.

####Clustering
####Early History- continued
In 2007 Google developed Source Biasing, an algorithm that allows “a search administrator [to] call upon the system to place a newer, 
more frequently used content management data at the top of the results page”. 
This means that when we search for something online, our search will be directed to the latest iteration of that search. 
Which is beneficial because we wouldn’t want to be directed to a version of our search that takes us into the obsolete past

##From Clustering to Segmentation- The Good
####Customer Segmentation- clustering customer into groups with similar characteristics 
It’s “a powerful tool to identify unsatisfied customer needs”
Customers are segmented according to:
i  Demographic information- gender, marital status, income, education, etc
ii Geographical information- city, state, country or even global region 
iii Psychographics- social class, personality traits, lifestyle
iv Behavioral data- spending and consumption habits, product/service usage

####Segmentation allows for:
Appropriate pricing
Customized marketing campaigns
Optimal distribution strategies
Prioritize new product developments
To sum up- by identifying individual needs, companies are better positioned to meet those needs.
Consumers, on the other hand, will maximize their online searches by having quick access to what they are looking for.
From the beginning Microsoft felt the need for “a semblance of order to search results”.

###The Filter Bubble- The Bad
####You are in a filter bubble when “everything you see online only reinforces your core beliefs, turning you into a superficial parody of an opinionated person”.
Social media platforms define what is newsworthy and what is to be discarded
So the system privileges the loud factions of each sector of society
Stories to be covered by the media need to pass a relevance test which is basically how many likes it gets
“The filter bubble has redefined the news as readers are the new publishers. Essentially anger sells, and the more radical you are the more you will be 
likely to be able to shape the conversation”. It pushes us into opposing directions and brings out the worst in all of us.

###Who, in 2014, would have thought that Donald Trump could be elected?
The liberal media was left trying to deal with its own blindness
By reading only what was fed to them, Democrats were unaware of the vast following that Trump had
But some are thriving with this model
Facebook and Twitter “pander to our natural human desire to congregate with others like ourselves”.
Is the Facebook “like” undemocratic since it stifles freedom of speech?
Are online polls even scientific?

###Last Thoughts- The Ugly
####Members of Far-right groups storm the Capitol
####The lack of access to opposing views leads to irrational behavior
