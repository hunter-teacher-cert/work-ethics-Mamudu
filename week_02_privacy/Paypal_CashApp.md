# Paypal vs CashApp
# PayPal Privacy Statement
Effective September 21, 2021

# Overview
This privacy statement explains how and why PayPal collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services. Reading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.

“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.

“PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc. This privacy statement applies to the PayPal, Braintree and Xoom services offered by PayPal. To learn about our privacy practices for Venmo, Honey, Hyperwallet or Simility visit the website and review the privacy statement for those services.

# Your privacy rights and choices
When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.

# Understanding your rights
You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months. You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you. If you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us or submit your request from your account settings. We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights. If you are a California resident, learn more about how we have handled your Privacy Rights.

If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.

If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:

Log in to your account and delete information you previously added. For example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings
Call us and request that we delete specific information
Close your account
If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:
Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us
Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity
Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech
Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services
# Comply with laws
Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data. For example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Consumers may read our Consumer Privacy Notice for more information about their rights under US federal law.

# Understanding your choices
You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.

# Choose how we collect personal data
You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.

For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.

# Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data
If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.

You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.

# Choose how we communicate with you
Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.

You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.

You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.

# The personal data we collect
We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.

If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location. When you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law. We may connect this information with your account, if you have one or if you create an account at a later date.

Here are the kinds of personal data that we may collect when you create an account or use our services:

1. Information that identifies you, for example:

First and last name
Address
Phone number
Email
IP address
Device Information
Information collected from cookies or other tracking technologies

# Where personal data comes from
We may collect personal information about you from various sources, for example from:

You, when you use PayPal or another PayPal service, such as Xoom or Venmo Merchants
Our payment partners, such as card networks and payment processors
Financial institutions, such as banks
Credit bureaus
Service providers, such as companies that help us manage risk and fraud, deliver services to you, and market our services
If you have an account with PayPal, we will associate information from all these sources with your account to improve your experience and for compliance and analytics purposes.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from people who are not allowed to use our sites and services, such as children under the age of 13. Contact us if you believe that we’ve mistakenly collected personal data from someone not allowed to use our services. We’ll delete it immediately, unless we’re legally required to keep it.

# How we use tracking technologies like cookies
We or our authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect personal data whenever you use our services, visit our sites, or visit websites that offer our services. The information collected with these technologies helps us personalize your experience, measure the effect of our ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.

You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services. But, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.

Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Because many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.

If you want to know more about how we use cookies, read our Cookie Statement. To learn how to opt-out of this kind of tracking technology, visit About Ads.

# Why we collect personal data
We collect personal data for many reasons, including to improve your experience, and to run our business. Specific reasons why we collect your personal data include:

Run our sites and provide better services, for example to help you send or request money, make purchases, show you your account information, verify access to your account, and keep your account and payment information up to date.
Manage and improve our business. For example, we do user research to improve our products’ performance and abilities. We also monitor and analyze our sites to help ensure they work as expected.
Protect our business and our customers from risk and fraud, including fraud that involves our business partners, strategic ventures, or other individuals and merchants, such as eBay, Inc.
Send you marketing information about our products and services. We may use personal data to market about our partners, such as merchants. We use personal data to better understand and cater to your interests.
Personalize your experience when you use our sites and services, as well as other third-party sites and services. In this case, we might use tracking technologies like cookies. See our Cookie Statement for more details.
Send you locally relevant options, but only if you agree to let us track your location. If you do, this can help us enhance the security of our sites and services, and customize our services by using the right language and personalizing content such as ads and search results.
Make it easy for you to find and connect with others. For instance, if you let us access your contacts, we can suggest connections with people you may know.
Contact you when you need us, such as answering a question you sent to our customer service team.
Comply with laws and enforce our agreements with you and other people who use our services.
If you choose to receive a digital receipt via email or text when completing a payment in-store, we’ll remember your choice the next time you check-out with the same payment card.
 
# How and why we share personal data
We do not sell your personal data. However, we may share personal data across our services and with other members of the PayPal corporate family. Sometimes we share the personal data we collect with third parties to help us provide services, protect our customers from risk and fraud, market our products, and comply with legal obligations.

This helps them know they’re getting money from you (or that you requested a payment from them). We may also make certain information available to other Cash App customers to help them know they’re making a payment to the right person, such as when you joined Cash App and whether you appear in their contacts, and the number of people in their contacts who have also transacted with you. If you choose, we may also allow you to share additional information about you and your use of our Services with other Cash App customers.

With our Service Providers
With service providers who help us provide, maintain, and improve our Services (e.g., vendors who help us with fraud prevention, identity verification, and fee collection services), as well as financial institutions, payment networks, payment card associations, credit bureaus, carrying brokers, and other entities in connection with your payment, money transfer process, investing activity, or otherwise to help us provide the Services;
With service providers that help us run our advertising campaigns, contests, special offers, or other events or activities.

Aggregated and Anonymized Information
We also may share (within our group of companies or affiliates, or with service providers or other third parties) aggregated and/or anonymized information that does not specifically identify you or any individual user of our Services.

# COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGIES
Digital cookies and similar technologies help us make our services better to use by doing things like recognizing when you’ve signed in, analyzing how you use our services so we can make them more useful to you, giving you a more personalized experience, and making our ads to you work better.

When you interact with our online services, or open emails we send you, we obtain certain information using automated technologies, such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons, and other technologies. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an internet tag, pixel tag, or clear GIF, is a tiny graphic image that may be used in our websites or emails.

We use these automated technologies to collect your device information, internet activity information, and inferences as described above. These technologies help us to:

Remember your information so you do not have to re-enter it;
Track and understand how you use and interact with our online services and emails;
Tailor our online services to your preferences;
Measure how useful and effective our services and communications are to you; and
Otherwise manage and enhance our products and services.
We set some of these automated technologies ourselves, but others are set by third parties who deliver services on our behalf. For example, we may use other companies’ web analytics services (described in the “Third-Party Analytics Services” section), which use automated technologies to help us evaluate how customers use of our websites.

Your browser can alert you when cookies are placed on your device, and how you can stop or disable them via your browser settings. Please note, however, that without cookies all of the features of our online services may not work properly. If you use a mobile device, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by changing the privacy and security settings on your mobile device.

We use other companies as service providers to help us analyze our site, and track metrics. These service providers generally promised us under contract to keep data private but have their own privacy policies that you should be aware of.

We may use third-party analytics service providers to help us with our online services, such as Google Analytics, BugSnag, and Crashlytics. The analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and web server logs to help us analyze how you use our online services. We may disclose your site-use information (including IP address) to these analytics providers, and other service providers who use the information to help us figure out how you and others use our online services.

To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/ or https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en.

We keep your information as long as you keep using our products and services. After that, we keep it for as long as we need it to do things like fight fraud, collect fees you owe, resolve disputes with (or involving) you, follow the law, enforce our agreements and defend our rights in court.

We generally keep your information as long as reasonably necessary to provide you the Services or to comply with applicable law. However, even after you deactivate your account, we can retain copies of information about you and any transactions or Services in which you may have participated for a period of time that is consistent with applicable law, applicable statute of limitations or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, to detect or prevent fraud, to collect fees owed, to resolve disputes, to address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations, to enforce our General Terms or other applicable agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with applicable law.

RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
If you live in California, the following additional rights apply to you.

Right to Know

You may have the right to request, up to twice in a 12-month period, to see the following information about the personal information we have collected about you during the past 12 months:

The categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you; 
The categories of sources from which we collected the personal information; 
The business or commercial purpose for which we collected the personal information; 
The categories of third parties with whom we shared the personal information;  and
The categories of personal information about you that we disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed that information for a business purpose.
To request the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, see “How to exercise your rights” below. You may find all of the other information listed above in this Privacy Notice.

California law gives you the right to ask if we disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes (we do not disclose your personal information for others’ direct marketing purposes). It also gives you the right to ask if we sell your personal information to third parties (we do not sell your personal information and have not done so in the past), and if we did (which we don’t), you’d have the right to opt out of such sales.

Right of Deletion

You have the right to ask us to delete the personal information we have collected from you (subject to exceptions the law provides). Please note that you may no longer be able to use our Services if you delete your personal information.

Right of Non-Discrimination

You have the right to not be discriminated against if you exercise these privacy rights. We will not discriminate against you, deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.

How to Exercise Your Rights

If you live in California and would like to send us a request to exercise one of your above rights, you may do so online at https://cash.app or by contacting us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section below.

To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity and will require you to be logged in to your Cash App account before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request.

You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf as permitted under law, though before we process that request, we will require that you provide the authorized agent written permission to do so and verify your identity directly with us.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.

Exceptions to These Rights

California law provides for certain exceptions to the rights described above. We reserve the right to avail ourselves of these exceptions where applicable.

CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION
If you are a kid under 13, please don’t use our services. If we collect your data and later learn you are a kid under 13, we will delete it.

Our Services are general audience services not directed at children under the age of 13. If we learn that any information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that information.


# HOW WE SECURE INFORMATION
We do a lot to keep your data safe. While we think we have strong defenses in place, no one can ever guarantee that hackers won’t be able to break into our sites or steal your data while it is stored or flowing from you to us or vice versa.

We take reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your information from loss, theft, and misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Nevertheless, the internet is not a 100% secure environment, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of the transmission or storage of your information. We hold information about you both at our own premises and with the assistance of third-party service providers.

For more information about our security practices, please visit https://cash.app/security.


# STORAGE AND PROCESSING
We operate in many countries, and we (or our service providers) may move your data and process it outside the country where you live.

We may, and we may use third-party service providers to, process and store your information in the United States, Canada, Japan, the European Union, and other countries.
